1. Get file info maps for base, local index and remote index
2. For base, if files deleted from local, include with zero hash
    s.t local map becomes a subset of base
3. Download files from remote which are not found in base
    (since local now is a subset of base, no need to check existence in local)
4. Upload files from base to remote which are not in local
    4.1 file does not exist in neither local or remote, upload with version 1
    4.2 file does not exist in local but in remote, download with remote_ver + 1
    4.3 failure in syncing proceeds to download from remote
        prompt warning message
5. Handle conflict for files in local
    5.1 if not modified and behind remote version, download
    5.2 if modified and same version, upload
    5.3 if modified and behind version, download
        prompt warning message

Be careful:
1. ignore index files
2. put blocks first, then update file info map
3. modification invovles local index, file contents and remote file map
